# Check domain

You should check an web address especially the domain contained in an email before opening it in the web browser.
This can prevent you from accessing a website that tries to illegally steal credentials (phishing site) or spread malware.
In the following, practices and tools are provided that can help in this case.

## Find conspicuities

Does the domain have spelling errors? Have letters been replaced by numbers?
This cannot be a mistake, but full intention.
Criminals try to use similarities to trustworthy companies to suggest harmlessness.

## Use a domain checker

In order to check the safety of a domain or URL, a large number of domain checkers can assist you online.
They are provided by initiatives of online communities and anti-virus software companies.
A selection of these tools is listed here:

## Use a search engine

A search for the domain in a search engine of your choice can reveal,
whether the host is a reputable company and what experiences other users have made with the domain.

## Check DNS entry

A domain is translated into an IP address using a Domain Name System (DNS) and then the
server with this IP address is requested.
In addition to the IP address, information about the owner of the domain is also stored at the DNS.
This information can help to find out whether it is safe to access the address.

* https://www.whois.com/whois/

## Nothing unusual found so far?

That is already good.
However, it does not mean that you can visit the address without hesitation.

For example, the domain could be a redirection service, with which criminals might try to disguise the actual target page.
In this case, you can get more information at some services by adding a '+' to the URL.

In addition, some checks use blocking lists.
These do not include all malicious websites that are currently available online.
Thus, even if nothing suspicious is found, caution should be exercised with any web address
that you do not know and do not trust 100%.
